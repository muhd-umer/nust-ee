Several years ago, when I was still in high school, I was assigned the task, homework rather, to construct a model of the globe using recycle material. I, being a much docile student, noted it in my journal, that was then serving the purpose of a to-do list, and returned home. If I recall correctly, the deadline to it was a month and a half. Now, my plan was to finish it as soon as possible and go take a long break and rest all the way through, things, however, did not proceed way I had planned them to. I procrastinated all the way until it was only one week left, and the end result of my project was deplorable, to say the least.
